Domino Project 1

Domino is a board game and will be played by two players.

The game will use a full set of dominoes with 28 pieces

Every player will receive seven pieces randomly, and keep them secret.

The other dominoes should be available to purchase when the game start

The game starts with the player that has the highest double piece. In case no one has a double piece, the player that has the highest single starts.

Players will take turns playing a domino on the table.

The player should be able to choose a piece to play.

The players have to play a domino piece with a value matching the adjacent square on the adjacent piece

If the player doesnâ€™t have a piece to play, they will have to buy one piece from the purchase pile.

If the the pile is empty the player will pass their turn

The game ends when the first player finishes their pieces.

In case of a draw, the player with the lowest number of value points in their hand wins.
